Hello! My name is Kenny, and I'm a wearer of many hats. Most recently, I worked at Jane Street doing Strategy and Product, a flexible role involving data analytics, project management, and problem solving on a daily basis. Prior to that, I graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor's of Science and Engineering in Operations Research and Financial Engineering, as well as four minors in variety of technical disciplines. I've served in many leadership roles, including as an officer of Princeton Data Science club and co-vice president of our Table Tennis Club. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, trying the hottest restaurants in NYC, and watching football and basketball, and a recent interest of mine is archery. Feel free to take a look below and see some of things I've worked on! You can also find [my resume here](./Resume_081722.pdf){:target="_blank"} and a [brief timeline of my journey thus far here](./timeline){:target="_blank"}.
