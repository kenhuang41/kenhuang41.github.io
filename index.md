Hello! I’m Kenny, a versatile professional with a diverse background. Most recently, I worked at Jane Street in a Strategy and Product role, where I engaged in data analytics, project management, and daily problem-solving. At this leading quantitative trading firm, I regularly leveraged million-row datasets to produce value for traders and collaborated with teams across trading and sales on strategies for handling billions of dollars in trading capital.

I graduated from Princeton University in 2023 with a BSE in Operations Research and Financial Engineering, along with four minors in technical fields such as Statistics, Machine Learning, and Applied Mathematics. I also gained valuable experience through extracurricular projects in sports analytics and conducted research on advanced linear algebra techniques.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I’ve taken on several leadership roles, including serving as a DataDev subteam officer in the Princeton Data Science Club and as co-vice president of the Table Tennis Club.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing volleyball, exploring NYC’s hottest restaurants, and following football and basketball. Recently, I’ve also developed an interest in archery.
