Hello! My name is Kenny, and I'm a wearer of many hats. Most recently, I worked at Jane Street doing Strategy and Product, a flexible role involving data analytics, project management, and problem solving on a daily basis. Prior to that, I graduated from Princeton University with a BSE in Operations Research and Financial Engineering, as well as four minors in a variety of technical disciplines. I've also served in many leadership roles, including as an officer of Princeton Data Science club and co-vice president of our Table Tennis Club. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, trying the hottest restaurants in NYC, and watching football and basketball, and a recent interest of mine is archery. Feel free to take a look below and see some of things I've worked on! You can also find [my resume here](./Resume_081722.pdf){:target="_blank"} and a [brief timeline of my journey thus far here](./timeline){:target="_blank"}.
