Heyo! I'm a senior studying Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University and pursuing a career in data analytics, finance, and basically anything that involves getting my hands dirty solving problems. I currently serve as an officer on the DataDev team of Princeton Data Science, and I am also co-vice president of our Table Tennis Club. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, cooking, and scrolling through Reddit, and a recent interest of mine is playing flag football. Feel free to take a look below and see some of things I've been working on! You can also find [my resume here](./Resume_081722.pdf){:target="_blank"} and a [brief timeline of my journey thus far here](./timeline){:target="_blank"}.
