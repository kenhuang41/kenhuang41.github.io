Not too sure what I'm doing here but hopefully it looks okayy~

## Me

Feel free to take a look around the website at some of things I've been working on! If you're hiring for an internship and looking for a data-loving dude with a clown personality, do please contact me at kh19 [at] princeton [dot] edu. I'm also always willing to talk about any of the following character strings, if they mean anything to you :D

* MFFL
* RV / SM
* DC4L
* 163 (game)
* A man from WÃ¼rzburg, Germany
