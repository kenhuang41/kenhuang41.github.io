    <h2>A Chronicle of My Greece Trip</h2>
    <h3>May 13 - 22, 2022</h3>
    <p>In the summer of 2022, my family and I went on a vacation to the beautiful Mediterranean country of Greece. Over 10 days, we visited countless 
attractions, from ancient relics like the Acropolis to luxury spots in Santorini to beautiful ocean waters off the coast of Zakynthos. There were so 
many amazing experiences during our time there, and it was truly a vacation to remember. As for this travel log, I brought along my Smiski collectibles and thought it would 
be fun to document our experiences from their "eyes", written in letter format to my girlfriend Kathy. Enjoy!</p>
