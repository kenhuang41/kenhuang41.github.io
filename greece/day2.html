<p>hi mom, it’s smark today. smike said i was lazy yesterday so i guess i'm doing today’s letter to prove him wrong.</p>
 
<p>in fact, this was smike at breakfast. if anything he’s the lazy one smh. breakfast here is rly good and starts at 8 compared to the unreasonable times at home, so dad actually ate a lot.
today’s itinerary is the hanging monasteries of meteora. apparently some christians were being chased in the 14th century so they settled on the most inaccessible place they could find, which turned out to be the top of these massive rock spires. personally, i think they did pretty good. for example, this is varlaam, the second biggest of the six, but it and st. nickolas are closed on fridays so we couldn’t go inside ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>

<p>and of course i got a great picture in front of it.</p>
 
<p>the first one we went into was the great meteoron, which is the biggest and most popular one. smatt looks great as usual. (those are auntie’s nails. dad’s don’t look nearly as nice.)</p>
 
<p>we had to climb almost 300 steps but eventually we got there. this was the most steps of all the monasteries; the others were all 150 or less.</p>
 
<p>from the top, we could see the town from above, and it’s crazy how smol it looked. that’s how high we were. smike got scared.</p>

<p>edit: smike here. no i wasn’t!</p>
 
<p>also there was a cool tunnel so here’s a pic of dad being embarrassing</p>
 
<p>the next one we went to was my personal favorite. everyone else liked it too. it’s called the holy trinity monastery and it’s the only one where the greek spelling is not similar so i always got confused. i like it because it’s more detached from the road and because we had to climb down first before climbing the stairs and because smike then got tired climbing the stairs lolol
edit: yo smark stop spreading slander</p>

<p>note: smatt was rly feeling it today</p>

<p>we got some cool pics on top. here’s dad, although i’m not sure why his left hand looks so awkward.</p>

<p>from here, we went to st. stephen’s. this one was noteworthy because you don’t actually have to climb stairs, but that also meant that all the tour buses and school field trips had to come to this one so it was hella crowded. we ended up just taking pics of the garden in the front and dipped.
finally, we went to roussanou, which is the only nunnery that we saw today. it used to be a monastery too but then this lady in the 1950s rebuilt the ruins and these 16 nuns have been living here since 1988. it’s not as detached as the others but it looks a lot nicer and had way more pretty flowers that i really liked.
there was also a pretty sick bridge that you had to take to go inside.</p>

<p>it’s not the most flattering angle for smatt but you can see just how high and remote these monasteries are, which made them so amazing and awe inspiring to all of us. the weather was also rly nice and there was so much greenery everywhere.
at this point it was almost 3, so we headed down the mountain to get some lunch. our hotel recommended this place called platanos so we gave it a shot and it was indeed really good. i helped order and especially liked the tsaziki sauce with bread. the moussaka (eggplant lasagna) was just pretty good at the time but for some reason it’s the dish that i keep craving.
the souvlaki was also good but outshone by smatt being extra again. we also got this free dessert that was hella sweet but yummy. i especially liked the ice cream.
after lunch, we took a break at the hotel and then returned to the mountain for the sunset. we went to a couple of the scenic areas and got rly nice panoramic views of all of the monasteries except stephen’s. it’s kinda hard to tell but you can see 4 of them (great, varlaam, nickolas, rossanou) on one side and holy trinity on the other. sadly, it was super cloudy at sunset so it wasn’t super colorful, but it was still rly pretty and the wind felt nice and peaceful.
dad also told me to include this picture? he said mom would like this but i dont get why</p>

<p>after that we went back down and ate at this gyro place that had 4.9 stars on google maps. it was realllly good and had huge portions and we barely finished all of it. i don’t know if smike mentioned yesterday (edit: i did, thank you very much) but the food here in greece is so cheap. this meal ended up being about $14 total for all four of us, and it was fresh, quality stuff. we also stopped by this juice store and got fresh squeezed orange juice and mixed drink.
we asked the lady how to say thank you and kinda learned it (f harry’s toe apparently) but we kinda forgot it already tbh.</p>

<p>anyway, after that we went back to the hotel and went to sleep, although dad seemed annoyed at the super slow internet connection. today was a tiring but super fun day and i’m really glad dad brought us. we miss you, mom.</p>

<p>love,<br/>
